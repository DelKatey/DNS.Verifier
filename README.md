## Introduction

This repository contains all the files needed to compile a working version of **DNS Verifier**.

	
## How this program came to be

This was done as a random challenge set by a lecturer before internship.

## Installation

This was coded with Visual Studio 2010, using .NET Framework 3.5, and should thus be usable with any version of Visual Studio 2010 and up, as well as SharpDevelop. Compatibility wise, it should present no challenges in being converted to use a newer version of the .NET Framework.
